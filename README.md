# find_perfect_numbers

This practice script explores the mathematical concept of perfect numbers and mersenne primes, using python to implement and test various detection Modes.

A perfect Number equals the sum of its positive divisors excluding itself.
For Example:
  - 6 is a perfect number, because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Goal of this exercise was to determine whether a given Number is a perfect number, identifying Mersenne primes in a given range and use Mersenne primes to generate a list of perfect numbers up to a given limit.

This is my first public repo, so expect mistakes and please be patient with me. I'm also pretty new to coding in general, so feel free to help me improve by commenting and expanding on this concept.
